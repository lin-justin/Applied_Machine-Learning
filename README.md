# Applied Machine Learning

Dartmouth Quantitative Biomedical Sciences course taught by Professor Saeed Hassanpour where we learned the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning using sklearn, TensorFlow/Keras, and PyTorch.

Developed feed forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks using transfer learning on ResNet18, and recurrent neural networks with LSTM for sentiment analysis on the Yelp reviews dataset.
